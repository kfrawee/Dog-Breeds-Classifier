## Project Overview
In this project, I will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine‚Äôs breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I will make important design decisions about the user experience for my app. My goal is that by completing this lab, I understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
